## Installation

The repo contains a **Code Blocks** project. The code can be compiled using **Make** command line interface (such as the one from **MinGW compiler suite**). This is captured in the beginning of the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtNtgoqz2gE). In order to compile the plugin properly, ensure to get a copy of Steinberg VST SDK v2.4 into the **vstsdk2.4** folder.
